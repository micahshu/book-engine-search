# MERN_BookSearch_Engine

## Description

For this assignment we were tasked with reworking existing code to work with GraphQl API and Apollo Server. 

The application allows a user to search for books and return recommendations for similar books that they can then save to an account that they have created. 

## Installation

There is nothing to install to use this application.

There are the following packages required to run the application.

    *GraphQl
    *Mongoose
    *Node
    *Apollo-Server-Express
    *Bcrypt
    *Express
    *Jsonwebtoken
